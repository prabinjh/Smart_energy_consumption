# Smart Home Energy Consumption Analysis

## Project Overview
This project analyzes energy consumption in smart homes using hourly data from various smart homes. The goal is to understand the factors influencing energy consumption and build a predictive model.

## Dataset Description
The dataset includes the following features:
- **Energy_Consumption_kWh**: Total energy consumed (in kilowatt-hours).
- **Temperature_C**: Temperature in degrees Celsius.
- **Humidity_%**: Relative humidity percentage.
- **HVAC_Usage_kWh**: Energy consumption of the HVAC system.
- **Kitchen_Usage_kWh**: Energy consumption in the kitchen.
- **Electronics_Usage_kWh**: Energy consumption of electronic devices.
- **Occupancy**: Number of occupants in the home.
- **Weather_Conditions**: Categorical data describing the weather (e.g., Sunny, Rainy).
- **City**: Name of the Indian city where the home is located.

## Project Structure
- **Week 1: Data Cleaning**: Importing data, handling missing values, outlier detection, and time-series consistency.
- **Week 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Univariate and bivariate analysis, time-series analysis, and feature engineering.
- **Week 3: Machine Learning**: Building and evaluating a predictive model for energy consumption.

## How to Run the Code
To run the code in this repository:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required packages using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook and run the cells.

## Conclusion
The analysis provides insights into the factors affecting energy consumption in smart homes and demonstrates the use of machine learning techniques to predict energy consumption based on various features.
